## (Difficulty: ⋆\star⋆ ⋆\star⋆) Consider the following finite support signal: 

x[n]=(−1)nnfor n=1,2,30otherwise

Consider also its periodic repetition 

y[n]=∑k=−∞∞x[n+7k]y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n + 7k]y[n]=∑k=−∞∞​x[n+7k].

Compute the energy of x[n]x[n]x[n]. 

For a guide to entering numerical results, see here; infinity is written as oo, i.e. a double lowercase letter 'o'.
