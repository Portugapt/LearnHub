## First Module Review

* What are the common big data challenges that you will be building solutions for in this course?
  * Migrating existing on-premise workloads to the cloud
  * Analyzing large datasets at scale
  * Building streaming data pipelines
  * Applying machine learning to your datasets
* You have a large enterprise that will likely have many teams using their own Google Cloud Platform projects and resources. What should you be sure to have to help manage and administer these resources?
  * A defined Organization
  * Folders for teams and/or products
  * A defined access control policy with Cloud IAM

* If you don't have a large dataset of your own but still want to practice writing queries and building pipelines on Google Cloud Platform, what should you do?
  * Practice with the datasets in the Google Cloud Public Datasets program
  * Find other public datasets online and upload them into BigQuery
  * Work to create your own dataset and then upload it into BigQuery for analysis 
* As you saw in the demo, Compute Engine nodes on GCP are:
  * Allocated on demand, and you pay for the time that they are up.
